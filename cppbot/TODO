- 
- Add additional functionality to visualizer including map, ant data etc.
- Add water mirroring to pocket food sources to improve pick up efficiency
- Map recognition code


- Combat code
  - Start with dispersion fields:
    - No impact when approximately tied
    - Attractive when in much greater numbers
    - Repulsive when in much smaller numbers
    - Clustering as a collaboration coefficient, might need tweaking to work
  - Precise computations
    - Suicide catching
    - Less than 4v4 or 5v5 or something -> branch and bound, with lookahead trapping technique
  - Heuristics
    - "Owned" squares -> definitely greater than anything opposition can muster maximise our owned vs. their owned
    - Move ants to maximise self-coverage without giving too much ground
    - Move ants to maximise average coverage of opposing enemy squares
    - ??? these are dumb
  
   
Simultaneously
	- Combat genes
	- Genetic algorithm code
	- Influence map + map recognition
